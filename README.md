# Hold to Craft - No Strain Crafting Script for No Man's Sky

This is a simple compiled AutoHotkey script that will send the "e" or "d" key for crafting quickly as long as the key is held down. I made this script to prevent repetitive strain injury until Hello Games makes their crafting system less hostile to the player. Rather than attempt to buy a thousand iron plates from a station over the better part of an hour or spamming a key for just as long, this script allows the player to make that same amount of iron plates in under a minute.
## Installation

Simply go the [releases tab](https://github.com/Kubia-Beta/Hold_to_Craft/releases) to download the latest version of the executable. Take Hold.to.Craft.exe and put it somewhere convenient for you before or after you launch No Manâ€™s Sky.
    
## Usage

To use the script, simply launch the executable file. It will start active.

The scripts controls are simple, and have options for function keys ("F" keys) as well as 60% keyboards that lack them.

_USE SCRIPT:_ Hold `E` or `D` depending on the menu context.

_TOGGLE SCRIPT:_ `F1` or `CTRL + SHIFT + T`

_EXIT SCRIPT:_ `F4` or `CTRL + SHIFT + B`
## FAQ

#### Do I need AutoHotkey?

No, not anymore. The executable comes with all necessary components.

#### How do I know if it is on or off?

After launching, you will see a tray icon appear. By default, the program is on. After toggling the script, you will hear two beeps if you toggled the script OFF, and one beep if you toggle the script ON. You will hear a default Windows noise when you exit the script.

#### Can I change the hotkeys?

Only if you edit the .ahk file yourself and run it. If there are enough requests for it, I will work on a version that will do a one time setup for custom hotkeys.
